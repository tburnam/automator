Thank you for downloading a Planet Font!

____________________________________________________________________________

This Planet font is a PC TrueType font. It has a full character set in both 
upper- and lower case, full punctuation, most international characters, 
accents etc. and it contains an extensive kerning table.

Currently all of the typefaces in the planet Font Family are CD-Ware and 
free for non-commercial use. That means, for each typeface you want to 
license for commercial use, you must mail us a CD of something you like: 
Music you have made, love or designed the cover for or a multimedia or 
software title...

Such a CD in our mailbox buys you a personal, non-transferable but 
everlasting license to use that typeface for commercial projects. And most 
probably a personal review of the CD from the font designer.

If you like what you did with our fonts, you are more than welcome to send a 
copy, a screenshot or a scan of the product back to us. We are always eager 
to see how people use the fonts, and we're collecting examples for future 
publishing on the web.
