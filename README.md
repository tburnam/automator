## What's Electron?

Electron is a framework that allows developers to build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
- `src/index.js` - Your javascript entry point.

You can learn more about the Electron-specific components within the [Electron Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start). You can also learn more about Electron and its API in the [documentation](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest).
